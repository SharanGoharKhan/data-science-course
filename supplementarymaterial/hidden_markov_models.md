Hidden Markov Models
=================

In Hidden Markov Models, or HMM for short, the learning goal is to estimate the maximum likelihood set of conditions that produced a specific _sequence_.

There are three fundamental problems for HMMs:

* Evaluation: Given the model parameters and observed data, calculate the likelihood of the data.

* Decoding: Given the model parameters and observed data, estimate the optimal sequence of hidden states.

* Learning: Given just the observed data, estimate the model parameters.
