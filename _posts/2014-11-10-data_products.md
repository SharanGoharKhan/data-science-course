## Objectives
We will be developing a classifier to predict an artist based on song lyrics. The training data comes from the [Million Song Dataset](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) and has been limited to knowledge of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and Lady Gaga.

After this lesson, you will have created a web application that lets users input lyrics and get back one of those three artists. In the process, you will have created a reusable classifier.


## Pre Reading Materials
This Flask application was cribbed heavily from the [Flaskr Tutorial](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/tutorial/introduction/). The [Flask Mega-Tutorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) is also fantastic, and much more in-depth if you are looking for greater challenges and experience.
