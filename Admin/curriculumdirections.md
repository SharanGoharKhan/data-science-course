Beginning with next week (5/19) we'll have five weeks remaining.

We'll reserve 1 week for final presentations.

Major Directions we might go for the remaining four include:

* Statistical and Mathematical Underpinnings
	* p-values, inference
* Data Analytics
	* munging, cleaning, subsetting, visualizing
* Developing Data Products
	* flask, shiny, d3
* Data Engineering
    * databases (SQL, NoSQL, Hadoop, scalable systems + infrastructure), maximizing speed + efficiency, writing Machine Learning from scratch
