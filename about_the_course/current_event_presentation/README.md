# Current Event Presentations

For each topical lesson, a student will be presenting on a recent article or news event which involves that lesson.

There will be a sign up system so that students will have the opportunity to plan choose which lesson they would like to present on.

Presentations are to be very brief, under five minutes, with the following headings:
* What is today's class topic?
* What is the title article or event that you are presenting?
* How does the article relate to the topic?
* How did the article help you realise why the topic is both cool and powerful?
