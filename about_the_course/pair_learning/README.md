# Pair Learning

In this course, we've reserved time during each class to work on guided pair learning following the "pair programming" paradigm.  

> Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer, pointer or navigator,[1] reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. _-[wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)_

One student will begin as _driver_ and the other as _navigator_, and they will switch off half-way throught the period.

## Benefits of Pair Learning
The benefits to working through data science topics using pair learning include:
* Greater focus
* Enhanced understanding of the material due to need to communicate 
* Getting to know your fellow scientists
* Its way funner

Here's a nice list of benefits from [Julia Evans](http://jvns.ca/)
>* You can timebox your pairing sessions, and have a specific goal: “We’re going to work for 1 hour on refactoring this library”.
* Explaining your code to someone makes you understand it better.
* Pairing on a boring task makes it way more fun. If you have a gnarly bug that you don’t want to fix, work on it with someone new to the codebase! They’ll learn something, and you’ll have company.
* Pairing is a good way to share knowledge. I get a lot of incidental learning out of pairing with people, seeing things they do that are new to me, and asking them questions.
* It keeps you honest. You can’t just stop coding and go look at cats when you’re pairing. (You actually can, but you both have to agree to go look at cats together.)

## Team Rotation
Students will have a different randomly selected (without replacement) partner to code with each week.
